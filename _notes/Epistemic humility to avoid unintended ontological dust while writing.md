When writing an essay _(applies to both opinion piece as well as factual ones)_, remember to clearly portray the epistemic humility[[**Epistemic Humility**: Recognizing the fragility of your epistemic confidence i.e., you (can) only know so much::rmn]], that is required of the subject in hand, in your writing. My observation has been that writing essays involve introduction of at least some amount of ontological dust that sprouts from past vague encounters or influences that you cannot remember. You cannot willingly avoid your perceptions and thoughts, but what you can definitely do is direct them to a more neutral ground by showing what you know is not all of it.
