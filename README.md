<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

**Purelog** is a responsive, sidebar theme for the popular JAMstack generator Jekyll that only uses the minimal [**Pure.css** framework](https://github.com/pure-css/pure) (hence the name!), while still following the best practices possible for accessibility and search-engine optimization.

I created this after finishing [Watery](https://github.com/brennanbrown/watery) (which this theme is built off of), as a way to add more functionality and design while still remaining as lightweight as possible.

This project is aimed towards those looking for an interesting theme for Jekyll that has features that aren't found commonly elsewhere, specifically having separate sections dedicated towards: blogging, note-taking, and daily journal entries.

### Features

Here are a few interesting features of this Jekyll theme:

- A fully customizable and empty `_BLANK_config.yml` to make getting up-and-running easy.
- A speedy, on-site search function using [Simply Jekyll Search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search).
- Custom collections for different types of material (note-taking, journal writing, etc.)
- An auto-generating archive page that displays all entries from _all_ collections.
- Auto-generating tags and categories pages.
- Having a `_pages` collection for easier organization.
- An author bio at the end of each post. (Located in `_includes/author.html`)
- Full Rouge support for syntax highlighting. (Currently using `base16.solarized.light`)
- Auto-generated RSS feed, sitemap, accessibility features, and search-engine optimization.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Jekyll requires the following:

- Ruby version **2.5.0** or higher
- RubyGems
- GCC and Make

See [Requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements) for guides and details.

### Instructions

1. Install all [prerequisites](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
2. Install the jekyll and bundler [gems](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems).

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

3. Clone this repository.

```

```

4. Change into your new directory.

```

```

5. Install gems from the `Gemfile`.

```

```

6. Build the site and make it available on a local server.

```

7. Browse to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

If you encounter any errors during this process, check that you have installed all the prerequisites in [Requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements).

If you still have issues, see [Troubleshooting](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#configuration-problems).

## Getting Started

Once you have Jekyll up-and-running, there are only a few steps needed to make this theme your own:

1. Fill out the `_BLANK_config.yml` configuration file and replace the current `_config.yml`
2. Remove the `example_posts` folder in `_posts`, `_notes`, `_journals` and start writing your own!
3. Modify or remove the pages in `_pages` to however you see fit.
4. _(Optional)_ Modify or remove this `README.md` with information about your own project or blog.
5. _(Optional)_ Modify the CSS files in the `assets` folder to customize the site.

### Analytics (optional)

This theme supports Google Analytics 4 (GA4):

- Set `google_analytics: G-XXXXXXXXXX` in `_config.yml` (or only in production via a separate config).
- The snippet only loads in production builds.
