A rather busy week for me, bee-wise. I've been spending more time on the forums and getting more into the weeds of things, which has been fun!

I realize now, at this point, I have Â±10 beemergencies a day. This is by design, as it pushes me to actually get my daily tasks done.

It doesn't really work for bigger tasks I have, like blog posts, where sometimes I try to just create something the last day instead of utilizing the whole week for it. I'm not really sure how to intelligently segment something like writing an article in a way that fits into how I use Beeminder.

## Systems Updates

- [**/distraction:**](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/distraction) Cleaned up the graph's jagged ups-and-downs in the road editor. I also changed the rules on RescueTime to be more strict with what's considered distracting so I waste less time on the computer.
- In general, I changed the views of a few older goals that I created back in 2017 to see their full range, rather than just when I restarted them. (Eg. [/productivity](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/productivity) and [/french](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/french). I hope this increased context helps provide better understanding. Similarly, I've made data points public where applicable.
- I also _still_ need to find a new solution to [/morning-pages](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/morning-pages), and this is my verbal contract to myself I'll have that corrected before next week's post.

I finally took a gander at [beemind.me](https://beemind.me) for new ideas, and I'll be going over the integrations megalist (now that I know it exists, hah) this week to see what else I can add.

My rule of thumb for new systems is this, I'll add it to my already large list of beemindings if I find a way to:

1. Automatically track what I already to.
2. Automatically track something I really want to start doing.
3. Automatically track something that's fun and takes less than five minutes (see /typing).
4. Or, manually tracking something I _need_ to start doing.

## New Systems

- [**/meta:**](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/meta) I've been trying to figure out what my meta goal should be for awhile, and I think tracking the daily cumulative data points from my other systems fits. It's definitely more interesting/fun than helpful right now, but why not?
- [**/typing:**](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/typing) I love typing games, and have been using [KeyHero](https://www.keyhero.com/profile/brennanbrown) forever, so why not give TypeRacer a try! Only problem is that it isn't working. :( No matter what I do, I get a "Could not fetch scores." for the value. I don't know if it's worth making a dedicated thread for?
